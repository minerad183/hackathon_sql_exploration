# hackathon_sql_exploration
Three-day hackathon created by General Assembly to explore the Kiva database. The objective is to make an API call to kiva, gather around 100,000 records using GraphSQL query parameters, ETL the data into a Postgres custom-made database, and analyze the data for interesting findings.
