# Hackathon: Exploration and Analysis of Data Using SQL
Three-day hackathon created by General Assembly to explore the Kiva database. The objective is to make an API call to kiva, gather around 100,000 records using GraphSQL query parameters, ETL the data into a Postgres custom-made database, and analyze the data for interesting findings.

- Kiva's [docs](https://www.kiva.org/build/docs)
- API call and transformation (the ET of ETL) are in the Jupyter Notebook file. The Load and database creation is in the create-tables SQL file. Some sample queries are in the query-code SQL file in the Data folder.
-  **Note, you will need the activities.csv and sectors.csv files to be retained for reference purposes.**
-  Presentation of analysis and findings soon to come.
